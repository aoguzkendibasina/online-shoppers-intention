# About Dataset
The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions.

The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.

The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes.
